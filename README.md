# Driving-Test-Booker

A script for use with the Greasemonkey browser (firefox) addon that will monitor the Australian Departement of Transport for available driving test appointments.
When one is found within your nominal dates, it will automatically select and give you 20 minutes to finalize your booking. On succesful match, you will be notifed with a audible sound (kindly provided by www.nyan.cat).

This script is useful for people wishing to obtain their car license ASAP, as appointment cancellations are made frequently and then become available earlier than expected. This is what this program capitalizes on.

Adjust <em>this.chosenDate</em> variable to set your prefered date to have your appointment by.
